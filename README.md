Binary Search Tree

This project is a simple implementation of a binary search tree in Java, created as an exercise for learning and understanding the binary search tree data structure.

Description

ListItem is an abstract class that defines the basic attributes and methods to be used by the elements of the binary tree.
Node class inherits ListItem and represents a concrete implementation of a node in the tree.
MyLinkedList class is a basic implementation of a doubly linked list used for the binary tree.
SearchTree class implements a binary search tree using MyLinkedList.

Note

This project is intended for practice and deeper understanding of the binary search tree as a data structure. It is not a full-fledged application but rather a simplified implementation focusing on the fundamental concepts of the binary search tree.
